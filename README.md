These dynamic calculations help provide deeper insights into sales performance, customer behavior, and operational efficiency.
- **Key Features**:
  - KPIs Dashboard: Displays vital key performance indicators (KPIs) like total sales, average order value, and sales growth, providing quick insights into overall business performance.
  - Customer Analysis: Analyzes customer behavior with segmentation by demographics, purchase frequency, and customer value, helping businesses understand their customer base.
  - Order Status: Provides real-time insights into the order pipeline, showcasing metrics like order fulfillment rate, cancelled orders, completed orders, and a table showing raw data allowing businesses to track the status of each order.
  - Shipping Analysis: Visualizes shipping performance, shipping costs, and shipping type with the best or worst performance to optimize logistics.
